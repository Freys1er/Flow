# Flow

## How to Create a Set
### To create a set with Flow, you need to follow a set of rules:
### If you are creating a flashcards set:
The flashcards in the set should be seperated by hashtags '#', in the order:
Question#Answer#Question#Answer
The website will automatically set every second # to the questions and the # after the answer

`Warning: If you are missing or added extra # then the set will not function properly, make sure that it is in good condition before submitting`

### If you are creating notes:

`<H1>This is a heading`

`<H2>This is a subheading`

`<H3>Some big text`

`<H4>Some reg text`

`<H5>Some Small Text`

`<BR>A break in the notes`
